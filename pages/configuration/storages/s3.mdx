## Example

In this case show S3 storage config example, the `S3_ACCESS_KEY_Id`, `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` is env variable.

If you don't want to use env, just set the key and secret in YAML.

```yml
models:
  my_app:
    databases:
      # ...
    storages:
      s3:
        type: s3
        bucket: my_app_backup
        region: us-east-1
        path: backups
        access_key_id: $S3_ACCESS_KEY_Id
        secret_access_key: $S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```
