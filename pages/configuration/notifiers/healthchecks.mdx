# Healthchecks

> Since: 2.15.0

[Healthchecks](https://healthchecks.io/) is a simple and effective cron job monitoring

Notifications can be sent on both `success` and `failure`. Healthchecks can reduce the number of messages if users
need to manage multiple backups while keeping active success notifications.

User can follow [Configuring checks](https://healthchecks.io/docs/configuring_checks/) and
[Configuring notifications](https://healthchecks.io/docs/configuring_notifications/) docs to setup healthchecks.
